# ofxSVGTiny is an addon for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/)

It uses [libsvgtiny](http://www.netsurf-browser.org/projects/libsvgtiny/) for SVG importing, which depends on [libxml](http://www.xmlsoft.org/). The example XCode project file assumes that you have libxml installed correctly at `/opt/local/include/libxml2/`.

ofxSVGTiny is currently OSX-only. Porting to Linux should be easy, porting to Windows is a bit harder.
